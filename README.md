A benchmark suite for my bachelor thesis

Running the simulation requires an installation of [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/). Some of the algorithms require the language [AMPL](https://ampl.com/), an accompanying license and a compatible linear program solver such as [Gurobi](http://www.gurobi.com/) or [CPLEX](https://www.ibm.com/analytics/cplex-optimizer).

The test suite can be ran with ```cargo test```.
